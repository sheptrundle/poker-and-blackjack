This project completed by me during the summer between 1st and 2nd year at UVA. It contains 2 files:

**1. blackjack.py:** A fully functioning blackjack game with random card selection, player choice bets, and a bank that changes through unlimited hands. 

**2. poker_hands.py:** A simulator that allows one to run many many possible combinations of 5-card hands, and see statistics on how often each poker hand appears.
